        <h2>Night is young!!</h2>
        <p>Why you standing over there, acting like you just don't care
            We can make our own kinda music
            We might come from different worlds, might not be your kinda girl
            But I just wanna let go and lose it
            We are lost and found
            So let's go turn the beat around
            And maybe find a brand new sound
            Let's turn it up right now (now)
            Because the night is young (whoa)
            And it's just begun (whoa)
            Let's get it started, get it started
            And go 'til the sun come up
            The night is young (whoa)
            The night is young
            The night is young
            Dance together, dance alone, let it out and let it show
            Changing colors under the stroll ride
            I just wanna have some fun, let my worries come undone
            Right here, right now, it's feeling so right
            We are lost and found
            So let's go turn the beat around
            And maybe find a brand new sound
            Let's turn it up right now (now)
            Because the night is young (whoa)
            And it's just begun (whoa)
            Let's get it started, get it started
            And go 'til the sun come up
            The night is young (whoa)
            The night is young
            The night is young
            And I wish that it would never end
            I wish the song could play and play
            Be who you wanna be and then
            Just let the rhythm take you there
            Because the night is young
            And it's just begun
            Let's get it started, get it started
            And go 'til the sun come up
            Because the night is young (oh, the night is young, yeah)
            And it's just begun (it's just begun)
            Let's get it started, get it started
            And go 'til the sun come up
            The night is young (whoa)
            The night is young
            The night is young
            </p>
